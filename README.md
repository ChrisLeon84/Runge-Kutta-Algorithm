# Runge-Kutta-Algorithm

Algorithm to solve a system of first order differential equations (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#The_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_method)), written in Python. The algorithm is useful for Hamtilonian mechanics since the equations there are:

q<sub>i</sub> =  ∂H/∂p<sub>i</sub> 

p<sub>i</sub> = - ∂H/∂q<sub>i</sub> 

The algorithm was tested using celestial mechanics. The initial coniditions of an asteriod are given and the trajectory is was then computed. Assignment for graduate course in computational physics.
